Description
-----------

Backdrop is a fully-featured content management system that allows non-technical
users to manage a wide-variety of content. It can be used to create all kinds of
websites including blogs, image galleries, social networks, intranets, and more.

Backdrop aims to provide:
- A CMS that can be used out-of-the-box.
- Code that can be learned quickly.
- Extensible APIs.

Requirements
------------
- PHP 5.3.2 or higher
- MySQL 5.0.15 or higher with PDO enabled

Installation
------------

1. Create a new database, username, and password for Backdrop to use in MySQL.

2. Point your browser at the URL of your Backdrop installation. You will be 
   redirected to the install screen. If you're not redirected, visit the install
   URL. If Backdrop was installed at
   http://example.com/backdrop, the install URL would be
   http://example.com/backdrop/core/install.php.

3. Follow the instructions provided by the installer.

Bug Reports and Feature Requests
--------------------------------
Please use the Github
[issue tracker](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues) for
reporting all bugs and features. We use a separate issue tracker that is not
part of the main Backdrop code repository because of Github's restrictions on
the use of labels and issue management.

Developers
----------
Backdrop is a fork of Drupal. It preserves the legacy audience of developers who
value ease of use and speed of learning over architectural flexibility. You can
join Backdrop's developer community by
[forking Backdrop](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop).

When submitting a pull request, please make sure there is an open issue in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues)
and reference it in the description on the pull request.
